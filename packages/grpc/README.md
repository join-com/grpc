## How to use this library

### Requirements

1. `protoc`: It's a command line tool used to deal with
   [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) definitions. You can install it by typing
   `brew install protobuf`.
2. `protoc-gen-tsx`: It's a plugin for `protoc` that allows us to generate TypeScript code from our `.proto` definition
   files. You can find the install instructions [here](https://github.com/join-com/protoc-gen-ts/).
