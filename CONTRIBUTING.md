# Coding Rules

## Class definitions

1. Every defined class should have its interface counterpart to ease testing and refactoring.
2. Methods ordering:
   1. In first place, the constructor.
   2. In second place, public methods, ordered lexicographically.
   3. In third place, private methods, ordered lexicographically.
3. Mark properties as `private` when possible.
4. Mark properties as `readonly` when possible.
